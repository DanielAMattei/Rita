### Rita 1.2.0

## MINOR CHANGES:

# Rita():

- Rita() now has a new argument, return, which indicates whether the transformed variables of the best performing method 
  are returned (return = T; default), or the cleaned, untransformed values and variables that are eligible for 
  transformation (return = F).


### Rita 1.1.0

## MINOR CHANGES:

# Rita():

- Numeric columns with 2 distinct values or less are now removed prior to analysis.

- Minor formatting of missing values output.

# SWTest():

- SWTest() now has a new argument, warn, which indicates whether a warning should be printed when resampling is used
  or if the test is terminated, and its documentation is updated accordingly.

- When the sample-size is less than 3 and warn = T, the SWTest() function will terminate the test.

- When the sample-size is greater than 5000 and warn = T, the SWTest() function will now resample values with replacement 
  from the input object and perform the test on the resulting vector.

# JBTest():
  
- JBTest() now has a new argument, warn, which indicates whether a warning should be printed when bootstrapping is 
  used or if the test is terminated, and its documentation is updated accordingly. 

- When the sample-size is less than 4 and warn = T, the JBTest() function will now return a message
  indicating that the Jarque-bera test could not be performed.

- When the sample-size is greater than 4 and < 2000, and warn = T, the JBTest() function will now return a message
  indicating that boostrapping is used to obtain the p-value.

# DPTest():

- DPTest() now has a new argument, warn, which indicates whether a warning should be printed when the test is
  terminated, and its documentation is updated accordingly. 

- When the sample-size is less than 8 and warn = T, the DPTest() will now return a message
  indicating that the D'agostino Pearson Omnibus test could not be performed.

# logitXform():

- An additional variant of the empirical logit transformation is now used if output of the original empirical
  logit method consists of a single distinct value. This is accomplished through the use of a new argument, divisor,
  which modifies epsilon as needed and should not be changed by the user.
